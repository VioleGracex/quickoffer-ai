Generate SSL Certificates
If you haven't already, generate SSL certificates. For testing purposes, you can use self-signed certificates. For production, use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) like Let's Encrypt.

2. Update your FastAPI Application
You do not need to change your FastAPI application code to switch between HTTP and HTTPS. Instead, you configure this at the server level.

3. Run FastAPI with HTTPS using Uvicorn
When you run your FastAPI application using uvicorn, you can specify the SSL certificate and key files as command-line arguments.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to do it:

# bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 443 --ssl-keyfile=path/to/key.pem --ssl-certfile=path/to/cert.pem
